# Dotfiles
Personal Linux Dotfiles
This repo contains my personal config dotfiles for ranger, vim, vimperator and i3.
It's used to sync these configs between my ubuntu and arch machine.
The i3 config file is properly commented and relatively clean, but it changes frequently and some things doesn't work properly.
It's also "custom" subdivided and, on my machines, properly vim-folded (maybe I will inculde that as well, later).
The ranger files are mostly vanilla.
The vim/vimperator files are a mess and pieces of weld-together garbage that's at least working properly.
